# Kuzma_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Project Summary:
Online Phone Directory: This program will be a way for people to store their names, phone numbers, and addresses in a hash table so that other users can search for their friends easily.  One major implementation the hash table will have is the ability to edit an entry.  So if a user entered their data wrong and needed to change any of the three elements of their entry, they will be able to edit by selecting a function to guide them through the process of editing their information.  The user will open the program and be met with a screen of options including: Adding an Entry, Deleting an Entry, Finding an Entry, Editing an Entry,  Print Entire Directory and Exiting the Program.  Within the "Editing an Entry" function, one will be met with another menu to select whether to edit the name, phone number, or address of their entry.
