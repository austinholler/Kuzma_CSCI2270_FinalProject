Project Summary:
Online Phone Directory: This program will allow people to store their friend's contact in terms of names, phone numbers, and email addresses in a hash table so that other users can search for their friend's contact easily.  One major implementation the hash table will have is the ability to edit an entry.  So if a user entered their data wrong and needed to change any of the three elements of their entry, they will be able to edit by selecting a function to guide them through the process of editing their information.  The user will open the program and a list of options will be presented to the user, which include function such as: Adding an Entry, Deleting an Entry, Finding an Entry, Editing an Entry,  Print Entire Directory and Exiting the Program.  Within the "Editing an Entry" function, one will be met with another menu to select whether to edit the name, phone number, or address of their entry.

How to Run: To run this program, the user will first need to compile the main.cpp and pdirectory.cpp. Since we are not using hard coding, one will need to enter a command line argument of the desired text file, which in this case is the "CurrentDirectory.txt".
